Project Description:

LabelWise is a mobile application designed to help users instantly 
determine whether packaged food items are safe based on their dietary 
preferences and restrictions. The app scans product ingredient lists and 
uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to analyze ingredient lists and 
identifies whether the item is safe, unsafe or requires caution. 

Additionally, LabelWise provides personalized alternative product 
suggestions and includes an AI-powered chatbot that generates customized 
recipes based on users’ dietary preferences and previously verified safe 
foods. 

This app aims to eliminate the frustration and uncertainty of reading 
complex ingredient labels, especially for individuals with allergies, 
dietary restrictions, or ethical food preferences.
